###DOCUMENTATIONS

**A. Installation**
 
 Before using this, make sure you have installing meteor with version

 instruction:
 
 1. Git clone or download this repo. "git clone https://github.com/radiegtya/meteoris.git"

 4. There will be a running DEMO to get you started easily. Register your account from registration page, then  loging in using those
 account. You can then use the demo CRUDSS app.

**B. Folder Structure**
```
client/ 				# Client folder
    assets/             # Packages with global variable
    configs/            # Configuration files on the client
    css/                # Css files

    collections/        # Your collection files
    controllers/        # Your controllers files
        backend/        # Backend Controllers logical

```

**C. Routing, Controller and Views**

*1. What is a Controller*

Controllers are class which are responsible for displaying dynamic data in the view.

*2. Creating a Controller (Backend)*

Let's create a simple controller named PostsController that extends MeteorisController.
```
PostsController = MeteorisController.extend({

});
```
> save this file in "lib/controllers/PostsController.js"

*3. Create function inside Controller (Backend)*
```
Backend.PostsController = MeteorisController.extend({
	getOtherMessage: function(){
            return "my Name is Ega Wachid Radiegtya";
	},
	/* passing data from controllers to view */
    data: function() {
	    var otherMessage = this.getOtherMessage();
        return {
			helloWorld: "Hello World",        
			otherMessage: otherMessage,
        };
    },
});
```
> save this file in "lib/controllers/backend/PostsController.js"

function data is responsible  for storing dynamic data to be displayed in the view. Create a view with related name, remember this is a best practice naming convention in Meteoris.

*4. Create html page to be used with Controller*
```
<template name="backendPostsIndex">
	<p>{{helloWorld}}</p>
	<p>{{otherMessage}}</p>
</template>
```
> save this file in "client/views/backend/posts/index.html"

*5. Setup your router* 
Router is responsible for url formatting, for example if you want to redirect user to "AppName/posts/index". You can make routing like this. 

> Best practice note: 
> - AppName is your apps name
> - posts is your controller name or your folder in views name
> -  index is your view name inside folder posts
> This is a little different from MVC concept that other frameworks use, where index is 
>  function name from the controller. It's Because we are using MVVM concept.

```
    /* POSTS */
    this.route('backendPostsIndex', { //targetted template
        path: 'backend/posts/index/', //desired path
        controller: Backend.PostsController, //targetted controller
    });
``` 

> save this file in "lib/router.js"

*6. running your app*
To run your app, use this url http://localhost:3000/posts/index.
Now you should see "Hello World" and "my Name is Ega Wachid Radiegtya" message on your screen. Congratulation!
